Visualize omics and sequencing data in R.

## Information

The goal of this package is to provide simple functions to visualize several omics and sequencing data:

* `chromReads()`: draws a `ggplot2`-based horizontal barplot with the number and the percentage of reads mapped to each chromosome.
* `barDEGs()`: draws a `ggplot2`-based horizontal barplot with the upregulated and downregulated genes coming from DESeq2.
* `volcanoPlot()`: draws a `ggplot2`-based volcano plot with the DE data coming out from DESeq2.
* `DEcompare()`: draws a `ggplot2`-based scatter plot comparing the Log2FCs of two different contrasts.
* `barAnno()`: takes a list of modified outputs from `ChIPseeker::annotatePeak()`, computes the proportion of peaks in distal or promoter regions and draws a `ggplot2`-based barplot with the correseponding proportion for each sample.
* `getVennCounts()`: helper function that calls `ChIPpeakAnno::makeVennDiagram()` to intersect different sets of peaks and returns the Venn counts and a list of the peaks present in each set of peaks.
* `upsetPeaks()`: calls `getVennCounts()` and draws an UpSet plot using the Venn counts and the `UpSetR` package.
* `ggUpsetPeaks()`: calls `getVennCounts()` and draws a `ggplot2`-based UpSet plot using the Venn counts.
* `ggVennPeaks()`: calls `getVennCounts()` and draws a Venn diagram using the package `ggvenn`.
